1. Speed and internal implementation
For operations like search, insert, and delete HashSet takes constant time for these operations on average. HashSet is faster than TreeSet
HashSet is Implemented using a hash table.

2. Ordering
Elements in HashSet are not ordered.
TreeSet maintains objects in Sorted order defined by either Comparable or Comparator method in Java.
TreeSet elements are sorted in ascending order by default.
It offers several methods to deal with the ordered set like first(), last(), headSet(), tailSet(), etc.

3. Null Object
HashSet allows null object.
TreeSet doesn’t allow null Object and throw NullPointerException,
Why, because TreeSet uses compareTo() method to compare keys and compareTo() will throw java.lang.NullPointerException.

4. Comparison
HashSet uses the equals() method to compare two objects in Set and for detecting duplicates.
TreeSet uses compareTo() method for same purpose. If equals() and compareTo() are not consistent,
i.e. for two equal objects equals should return true while compareTo() should return zero,
then it will break the contract of Set interface and will allow duplicates in Set implementations like TreeSet

Note: If you want a sorted Set then it is better to add elements to HashSet and then convert it into TreeSet
rather than creating a TreeSet and adding elements to it.
